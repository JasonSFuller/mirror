# Building your own Kickstarts

If you build a vanilla system and fill out the questions with _mostly_
stock answers, you will get the following kickstarts, autogenerated by
anaconda.  IMHO, these aren't generic enough for general purpose use, as
it detects things during the installation and writes these specifics to
the kickstart (_e.g._ network devices and disks, which are unique to your
machine), but it's a good place to start when building your own.

Why build your own?  Because typing out the mirror's URL during the
installation is error prone and a giant PITA.  I like to select a distro
and walk away while it builds a system, no questions asked.

BTW, the password in these is hashed, but I used "password" (without
quotes) for all of them.  You can [effectively] replace that line with
`rootpw password`, and it'd be exactly the same.  But since I'm capturing
these as is, I left the sha512 hashes in the kickstart.
