# A timeout is included here, since this is the default menu loaded by syslinux.
#
# Normally, network boot is tried last.  If an OS is detected on an attached
# disk, the system will boot, giving it preference.  Conversely, if no OS is
# found, it will fallback to a network boot, and you can install an OS from this
# menu.  However, some people accidently (or intentionally) network boot first.
# If this is the case, you WANT the system to continue to boot if no one presses
# a button, hence the timeout.
#
# After the timer is cancelled (and when you go "back to the main menu"), it
# will not start up again... because that would be annoying. 

# Wait for 20 seconds
TIMEOUT 200
